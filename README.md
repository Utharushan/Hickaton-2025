# Hi!ckathon #6 - AI & Education Challenge

**Date:** November 2025  
**Associated with:** HEC Paris  
**Role:** Data Scientist & Product Designer

## Description
Selected for the 6th edition of the flagship AI hackathon organized by Hi! PARIS and corporate partners (L'Oréal, Capgemini, TotalEnergies, VINCI, Schneider Electric).

## The Challenge
3-day intensive sprint leveraging the massive PISA dataset (1.7 million student records, 300+ variables) to transform education through Artificial Intelligence.

## 1. Technical Task: Predictive Modeling
**Score:** RMSE 82.17

*   **Pipeline:** Developed a high-performance regression pipeline using XGBoost to predict student math scores.
*   **Data Engineering:** Handled complex missing data (imputation strategies, column pruning), feature selection via correlation matrix, and One-Hot Encoding.
*   **Optimization:** Fine-tuned hyperparameters (learning rate, max depth, estimators) using GridSearchCV to outperform baseline models (Linear Regression, Random Forest).

## 2. Business Task: Innovation Track - Student Mental Health
*   **Solution:** Designed a data-driven solution addressing student mental health (Issue #4).
*   **Value Proposition:** An AI-powered tool connecting students, teachers, and counselors to detect early signs of distress and optimize resource allocation in schools.
*   **Ethical AI:** Prioritized a Frugal AI approach (low-compute XGBoost) and strict data privacy compliance for sensitive student data.

## Skills
Programming, Python, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Presentations, Project Management, Statistical Programming, Data Science, Data Visualization, Algorithms, Statistics.
